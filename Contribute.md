# archpkg-helper

A cross-distro command-line utility that helps you search for packages and generate install commands for native package managers (pacman, AUR, apt, dnf, flatpak, snap). It aims to make discovering and installing software on Linux simpler, regardless of your distribution.

## About

archpkg-helper is designed to work across Linux distributions. While originally inspired by Arch Linux, it detects your system and generates appropriate install commands for common package managers. It's suitable for both newcomers and experienced users who want a simpler way to search and install packages.

## Features

Search for packages and generate install commands for:
- pacman (Arch), AUR, apt (Debian/Ubuntu), dnf (Fedora), flatpak, snap
- Cross-distro support (not limited to Arch)
- Clear, readable output and errors
- One-command setup via install.sh

## Quick Start (install.sh)

Install directly using the provided installer script.

From a cloned repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper.git
cd archpkg-helper
bash install.sh
```

Or run directly from the web:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper/main/install.sh | bash
# or
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper/main/install.sh | bash
```

Notes:

- The installer ensures Python, pip, and pipx are available and installs the CLI via pipx.
- You may be prompted for sudo to install prerequisites on your distro.

## Installation (Recommended: pipx)

On Arch and many other distros, system Python may be "externally managed" (PEP 668), which prevents global pip installs. pipx installs Python CLIs into isolated environments and puts their executables on your PATH—this is the easiest, safest method.

### Install pipx

Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

### Install archpkg-helper with pipx

Directly from GitHub:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper.git
```

From a local clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper.git
cd archpkg-helper
pipx install .
```

Upgrade later with:

```bash
pipx upgrade archpkg-helper
```

Ensure your shell session has pipx's bin path in PATH (pipx prints instructions after pipx ensurepath, typically ~/.local/bin).

## Alternative Installation (pip)

If you prefer pip, install in user scope to avoid system conflicts:

From a local clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper.git
cd archpkg-helper
python3 -m pip install --user .
```

Directly from GitHub:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper.git
```

If your distro enforces PEP 668 protections for global installs, you may see errors. You can bypass with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages .
```

However, using pipx is strongly recommended instead of breaking system protections.

## Usage

After installation, the CLI is available as archpkg.

Examples:

```bash
# Search for a package across supported sources
archpkg search <package-name>

# Generate install command(s) for a package
archpkg install <package-name>

# Generate removal command(s) for a package
archpkg remove <package-name>
```

Additional:

```bash
archpkg --help
archpkg --version
```

Replace <package-name> with the package you want to manage.
