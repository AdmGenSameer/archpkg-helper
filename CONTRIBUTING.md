## ‚ú® About archpkg-helper  

archpkg-helper is a **command-line interface (CLI) tool** designed to search and generate install commands for Linux packages from multiple sources:  

- Arch Linux official repositories (**pacman**)  
- Arch User Repository (**AUR**)  
- Flatpak (**flathub**)  

It supports **fuzzy matching, filtering, and interactive prompts**, helping users quickly find and install packages with the correct commands.
